\subsection{Workshop Safety}

The E-JUST Robotics Club recognizes the potential dangers and hazards inherent in assembling robotics, whether mechanical or electrical. Consequently, the club has put in place strict safety procedures to ensure the security of every member. In addition, a variety of safety gear is provided in the workshop, such as soldering fume extractors, protective gloves, and face guards. All operations are supervised by a professional safety director who makes sure that the extensive safety checklist found in Appendix B is strictly followed.
