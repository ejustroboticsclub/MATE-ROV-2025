\subsection{Safety Checklist}

All members participating in Kamikazeâ€™s deployment must follow a strict safety procedure enforced by the E-JUST Robotics Club. Routine inspections are conducted, and Appendix \ref{app:operational_safety_checklist} outlines a comprehensive operating safety standard. While all members are responsible for adhering to the safety checklist, its strict implementation is supervised by a trained safety director.
