\subsection{Full System Testing}

A comprehensive full-system test is crucial to ensur-
ing the optimal performance and reliability of our ROV before competition. This testing process evaluates all functionalities of the ROV, identifying any potential is-
sues and guaranteeing its readiness for the challenges it will face. The flowchart below (Figure \ref{fig:full_system_testing}) outlines the
systematic steps involved in our ROVâ€™s full-system test,
ensuring all critical aspects are examined.
