\subsection{Future Improvements}

E-JUST Robotics Club is committed to staying at the forefront of modern technology and achieving success through continuous improvement and innovation. The team places strong emphasis on developing cutting-edge solutions and is actively exploring new methods to upgrade its ROV systems.

\hspace{10pt} To support this vision, we are focusing on expanding the capabilities of our current ROV, Kamikaze, through the integration of advanced technologies and system enhancements. These improvements aim to increase efficiency, reliability, and adaptability in a variety of underwater scenarios. By investing in more powerful technologies, we aim to precisely locate the ROV, laying the groundwork for semi-autonomous and fully autonomous operations in the near future.

\hspace{10pt} As part of our future vision, we also aim to utilize Kamikaze in the fields of marine research and environmental sustainability. The ROV will be adapted to perform various underwater tasks that support scientific exploration, ecosystem monitoring, and environmental protection efforts.
