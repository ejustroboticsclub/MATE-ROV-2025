\paragraph{Frame} \ \\
\vspace{-0.5cm}

Kamikaze’s frame (Figure \ref{fig:frame}) is designed using a cuboid aluminum V-extrusion structure, providing a stable and modular foundation for mounting various components. The 20×20 and 20×40 aluminum extrusions offer a strong yet lightweight framework that maintains structural integrity in underwater conditions.

\hspace{10pt} To enhance stability and buoyancy, HDPE side frame sheets (Figure \ref{fig:side_frame}) are integrated into the design. These sheets not only contribute to the aesthetic appeal of the ROV but also help in maintaining balance during operations. Their strategic placement ensures that the ROV remains hydrodynamically stable while supporting the overall structural framework.

\hspace{10pt} The frame is designed with precise mounting slots, allowing secure positioning of thrusters, cameras, and operational tools while maintaining easy access for maintenance. The bolted assembly ensures that components can be reconfigured or replaced without permanent modifications.

\hspace{10pt} Additionally, the frame is tailored for the E-JUST Robotics team, ensuring compatibility with the mission requirements of the MATE ROV competition while balancing durability, weight efficiency, and adaptability.

\paragraph{Propulsion} \ \\
\vspace{-0.5cm}

Kamikaze is equipped with seven T200 Blue Robotics thrusters, strategically placed to achieve six degrees of freedom for precise maneuverability (Figure \ref{fig:dof}). This setup balances performance, power consumption, and cost-efficiency, ensuring mission success without excessive energy use.

\hspace{10pt} Using seven thrusters instead of a larger number reduces power draw while maintaining stability and control. Each thruster's power consumption is affected by drag force, given by:

\begin{equation}
    F_d = \frac{1}{2} C_d \rho A v^2
    \label{eq:drag_force}
\end{equation}

Where:

\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item \(F_d\) = Drag force (N)
    \item \(C_d\) = Drag coefficient (ROV shape-dependent)
    \item \(\rho\) = Water density (kg/m\(^3\))
    \item \(A\) = Cross-sectional area (m\(^2\))
    \item \(v\) = ROV velocity (m/s)
\end{itemize}

A CFD flow simulation was conducted to analyze water flow around Kamikaze (Figure \ref{fig:cfd}), minimizing drag and enhancing hydrodynamic efficiency.

\textbf{Trade-offs in Thruster Selection}
\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item \textbf{Power vs. Performance:} More thrusters improve stability but increase power consumption. Seven thrusters provide a balance between efficiency and control.
    \item \textbf{Cost vs. Mission Needs:} Reusing last year’s T200 thrusters reduces costs while still meeting competition requirements.

\paragraph{Main Canister} \ \\
\vspace{-0.5cm}

The canister serves as the primary enclosure for the ROV, protecting essential components such as microcontrollers, power systems, and sensors while ensuring pressure resistance, corrosion protection, and ease of maintenance. The design consists of a 3D-printed PETG body, an aluminum base, and a PETG lid with embedded acrylic windows, providing structural stability and waterproof integrity under operational conditions.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{Sections/2Design Rationale/images/canister.png}
    \caption{Kamikaze’s Main canister.}
    \label{fig:canister}
\end{figure}

\hspace{10pt} PETG was chosen as a cost-effective alternative to aluminum, offering a balance between mechanical strength and manufacturability. Although PETG is inherently waterproof, Sikadur®-31 CF sealant was applied to enhance structural integrity and reliability. The 3mm-thick aluminum base provides structural support for bulkhead glands, preventing layer separation and ensuring durability. The canister dimensions are 276×276×142.59 mm, optimized for component housing and pressure resistance. A three-stage sealing process was implemented, consisting of mechanical fastening, epoxy bonding, and polyurethane sealant, to maintain a watertight enclosure. The removable PETG lid, secured with M5 screws and dual O-rings, allows for easy inspection and maintenance, while four embedded acrylic windows provide visual access without disassembly.

\hspace{10pt} To evaluate structural performance, a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted:

\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item \textbf{Top View (Figure \ref{fig:top_fda}):} Stress is concentrated around circular openings and edges, which experience higher mechanical loads from water pressure.
    \item \textbf{Bottom View (Figure \ref{fig:bottom_fda}):} Bolted connections and interface zones between the base and side walls accumulate stress, making them susceptible to deformation.
\end{itemize}

Waterproofing is critical for the ROV’s performance and durability. The sealing approach protects electronic components while maintaining structural integrity under varying pressures. This design integrates 3D-printed PETG, aluminum, high-performance adhesives, and mechanical fasteners for optimal sealing efficiency.

For other cameras, Artelon enclosures replace aluminum.

    \item Acrylic cover sandwiched with an O-ring seal ensures water resistance.
    \item Allen bolts provide tight compression for long-term sealing.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Bolt Spacing Calculation for Optimal Sealing}

To ensure optimal sealing pressure and prevent gasket deformation under load, the bolt spacing (C) is calculated based on flange stiffness, gasket pressure, and deflection using equation \ref{eq:bolt_spacing}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:bolt_spacing}
    C = \left[ \frac{480 \left( \frac{a}{b} \right) E t^3 \Delta H}{13 P_{\text{min}} + 2 P_{\text{max}}} \right]^{1/4}
    \end{equation}
    where:
    \vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
        \item \(C\) = Bolt spacing (mm)
        \item \(a\) = Width of the flange plate (mm)
        \item \(b\) = Width of the gasket (mm)
        \item \(E\) = Modulus of elasticity of the flange material (Pa or N/m\(^2\))
        \item \(t\) = Thickness of the flange (mm)
        \item \(\Delta H\) = Max. gasket deflection - Min. gasket deflection (mm)
        \item \(P_{\text{min}}\) = Minimum gasket pressure (Pa or N/m\(^2\))
        \item \(P_{\text{max}}\) = Maximum gasket pressure (Pa or N/m\(^2\))

\paragraph{Grippers} \ \\
\vspace{-0.5cm}

Two claw grippers (Figure \ref{fig:grippers}) are designed to handle various item shapes and diameters. They are constructed from 10mm HDPE for durability and aluminum for fixation, ensuring a lightweight yet sturdy design. The grippers are pneumatically actuated using a 25mm stroke piston that applies 113–135N of force in both forward and backward directions. With a maximum opening width of 70mm, they can securely grip all required competition objects.

To enhance functionality, two screw hooks were integrated, enabling the ROV to lift hooks and manipulate ropes, expanding its operational capabilities.To optimize the gripper’s design and prevent potential bending stress-induced failures, a comprehensive stress analysis was performed. This theoretical evaluation ensured the gripper’s ability to withstand the designated weight. The results \ref{fig:grippers_analysis}confirmed that:

\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item The horizontal gripper can hold up to 14.6 kg.
    \item The vertical gripper can hold up to 11.8 kg.
    \item Both with a safety factor of 2.
