    \item Ensure that appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, goggles, and earmuffs are worn during all tasks.
    \item Sharp tools and equipment are stored properly when not in use, with blades covered or secured in racks or containers to prevent accidental cuts or injuries.
    \item Regularly check and maintain emergency kits, including fire extinguishers and first-aid supplies.
    \item Clearly label and store hazardous materials separately to ensure safe handling.
    \item Handle sharp tools with care, store them securely when not in use, and cover sharp edges with caps if available.
    \item Emergency response procedures are clearly outlined and accessible, including the location and condition of fire extinguishers, first aid kits, and emergency contact information.
    \item Maintain well-ventilated work areas and use additional fume extractors to prevent inhalation of harmful fumes while working with materials such as epoxy and soldering.
